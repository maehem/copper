/**
  * @brief SPI Library
  **********************************************************************
  * WiringPi includes a library which can make it easier to use the Raspberry
  * Pi’s on-board SPI interface.
  * Before you can use SPI interface, you may need to use the gpio utility to
  * load the SPI drivers into the kernel: 
  *     gpio load spi
  * If you need a buffer size of greater than 4KB, then you can specify the 
  * size (in KB) on the command line: 
  *     gpio load spi 100
  * will allocate a 100KB buffer. (You should rarely need this though, the
  * default is more than enough for most applications).

  * @brief:
  *   This is the way to initialise a channel (The Pi has 2 channels; 0 and 1).
  *   The speed parameter is an integer in the range 500,000 through 32,000,000
  *   and represents the SPI clock speed in Hz.
  *   The returned value is the Linux file-descriptor for the device, or -1
  *   on error. If an error has happened, you may use the standard errno global
  *   variable to see why.

  *   This performs a simultaneous write/read transaction over the selected

  *   from the SPI bus.
  *   That’s all there is in the helper library. It is possible to do simple
  *   read and writes over the SPI bus using the standard read() and write()
  *   system calls though – write() may be better to use for sending data to
  *   chains of shift registers, or those LED strings where you send RGB
  *   triplets of data. Devices such as A/D and D/A converters usually need
  *   to perform a concurrent write/read transaction to work.
