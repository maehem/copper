  * @brief Timing functions
  **********************************************************************
  * While Linux provides a multitude of system calls and functions to
  * providing various timing and sleeping functions, sometimes it can be
  * quite confusing, especially if you are new to Linux, so the ones
  * presented here mimic those available on the Arduino platform, making
  * porting code and writing new code somewhat easier.  
  * Note: Even if you are not using any of the input/output functions you
  * still need to call one of the wiringPi setup functions – just use 
  * wiringPiSetupSys() if you don’t need root access in your program.
