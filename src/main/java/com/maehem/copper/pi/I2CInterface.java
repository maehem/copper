/**
  * @brief I2C Library
  **********************************************************************
  * WiringPi includes a library which can make it easier to use the Raspberry 
  * Pi’s on-board I2C interface.  
  * Before you can use the I2C interface, you may need to use the gpio utility
  * to load the I2C drivers into the kernel: 
  *     gpio load i2c
  * If you need a baud rate other than the default 100Kbps, then you can supply
  * this on the command-line: 
  *     gpio load i2c 1000
  * will set the baud rate to 1000Kbps – ie. 1,000,000 bps.
  * (K here is times 1000)
