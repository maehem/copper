# copper-jni
## Description
Java Native Interface for the Copper project.

## Files
The .h file is the header file of native methods (or called them functions in C) generated by javah command.
The .c file is the implements of the native methods in InterfaceImpl.java.
The libc4copper.so is the dynamic library referenced by *Copper* Java class library, and the .so file is generated by the .c and .h file.

## How to use
If you just want to use wiringPi library in Java environments, you can just simply copy the file libc4copper.so to the system library path.<br />
        `sudo cp libc4copper.so /usr/lib`

On 64-bit Pi, You can also compile the native functions with:<br />
        `gcc -shared -I /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-arm64/include -I /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-arm64/include/linux  jwiringpi_JWiringPiInterfaceImpl.c -lwiringPi -lwiringPiDev -o libc4copper.so -Wall
`

And then cp libc4copper.so to the system library path.
*   Note: if you don't want to copy the library to the /usr/lib, you can specify the library path before running your Java program, like:
         `java -Djava.library.path=. YouProgram`
         (this specify the . directory as the native library path.)
